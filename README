Some simple lua programs to download, process, and generate graphs and
a paper for tracking the Corona Virus outbreak and making some
simplistic predictions.

========================================================================

This distribution contains
 - My Lua scripts and libraries to read and graph the data,
 - A copy of the Lua 5.3.5 distribution,
 - A copy of the Lua file system distribution,
 - A copy of Lua's penlight library distribution.
 - A copy of Lua's Date library distribution.
 - A copy of the gnuplot 5.2.8 distribution.

These are all included in an attempt to make this a single, get
everything you need, package. If you build and install this
distribution, you'll get all those tools.

However, the tools are placed in a sandbox, so they will/should not
overwrite any version of these things that are already installed on
your system.

I recommend that you make a temporary/working directory and untar
MyCorona.tar in that directory and then do the build.  You will end up
with:
  working_directory
    |
    +-> MyCorona  -- contains the distribution
    +-> bin       -- this and following directories all
    +-> include   -- contain results of the build.
    +-> lib
    +-> libexec
    +-> man
    +-> share

========================================================================

The DIST directory contains the distributions of Lua, Penlight, and
Lua File System used for these programs.  If running the MyCorona
scripts using Lua/etc already installed on your system gives you
unexpected results, I suggest building and installing these
distributions and then using them.

NOTE WELL: I HAVE DONE ALL OF THIS ON A MAC AND THE BUILD/INSTALL
PROCESS WORKS ON THAT.  IF YOU ARE ON SOMETHING ELSE, YOU MAY NEED TO
MODIFY THE PROCESS.  THE PROCESS USES SLIGHTLY MODIFIED FORMS OF THE
ORIGINAL MAKEFILES, SO IT PROBABLY WONT BE HARD. MOST LIKELY YOU WILL
NEED TO PLUMB SOME SPECIAL VARIABLE THROUGH THE MAKEFILES.

To build and install:  
  1) cd dist
  2) make
  3) make install
  4) cd ..
  5) ./bin/lua death-rate.lua (or whatever)

The distributions have been slightly modified so that they are
installed in ./bin, ./lib, and so on.  This way, these versions of
Lua, etc, will not interfere with whatever might be installed on your
machine. 

======================================================================
The scripts and libaries are
active-cases.lua
case-daily.lua
computed-cases.lua
death-daily.lua
death-rate.lua
death-vs-recovered-rate.lua
growth-percent.lua

fkgetopt.lua
   This is a library to do command line parsing.
library.lua
   This is a library of common functions/etc for the scripts.
   Functions are moderately well documented. What's missing
   is the higher level how to use:
   
       -- read in the entire dataset
       data_set = library.read_covid_19_data_csv(filename)

       -- Extract desired country's data
       country_data_set = library.get_country_data(data_set, country_name)

       -- Print the desired country's data.
       for date, record in tablex.sort(country_data) do
         print("Date: "..date.."  has "
               ..tostring(record.confirmed).." confirmed cases, "
               ..tostring(record.deaths).." deaths, and "
               ..tostring(record.recovered).." recovered cases.")
      end

test-days.lua
test.lua
   These are two test scripts I used in getting the libraries
   working properly.
